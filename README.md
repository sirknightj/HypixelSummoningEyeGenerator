# HypixelSummoningEyeGenerator
Extremely simple java program to output how many summoning eye drops each player got from a farming session.

The NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS determines how many players will be simulated and<br />
The ZEALOTS_PER_PLAYER determines how many zealots each player kills in each session.

The output file will contain the player number and the number of eyes they got in that session, separated by a tab.<br />
Each player will be outputted on their own line, for easy copy/pasting into Excel or Google Sheets.
